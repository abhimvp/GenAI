# Ultimate AWS Bedrock Guide: Build & Scale Generative AI Apps - ZTM

- In this course we deep dive into Generative AI , Large Language Models and Image Diffusion Models.
- Hands-on projects like conversational AI , code generation with bedrock models and image creation using diffusion models
- Deploy everything with a sleek serverless architecture leveraging AWS tools like API-GW,Lambda,S3 ..etc
- By the ENd , we master AWS Bedrock Generative AI , fine-tuning foundational Models on Bedrock with your own custom data and harness the power of llms and diffusion models
- A comprehensive course -> A comprehensive course aims to provide a complete and thorough understanding of a subject. It covers all the essential concepts, principles, and skills related to that subject, leaving no significant gaps in knowledge. Think of it as a "deep dive" into a topic.

## First Part of the Course:

- what is AWS Bedrock is as a service
- Look at how you can fine-tune your models with your custom data , look at all those hyperparameters like temparature , top p , top k, context length , max tokens & everything - pricing , model providers ..etc

## Second Part of the Course:

- create 3 hands-on projects & deployed on a serverless architecture
- **project1** ->`[codeGeneration]`use Postman/RestFox to call our route that lives in APIGW - once that route hits - it calls lambda function - it then call our bedrock model & the model generates the answers we want & it returns the answers and save the results to S3.
- **project2** ->`[Send Office Meeting Notes to Bedrock with some questions ask it to summarize it - basically chat with your data]`
- **project3** -> Use diffusion models to create images

### AWS Initial Setup

- create a aws free account
- Navigate to IAM to create user to access your AWS resources
  - Go to Users
  - create user
    - User name : BedrockCourseUser
    - check : Provide user access to AWS Management console
      - check : I want to create an IAM User - which is recommended
      - Console password - check : AutogeneratedPassword
      - check : Users must create a new password at next sign-in recommended
    - Next
  - Set permissions
    - check : Attach policies directly -> check : Administrator Access (Bad practice and idea but for now for this course we do this way to get going ) - In general in companies we follow principle of least provileges as we don't provide all the devs admin access
    - Next
  - Create User
- We get a link : the iam user to login from now on & username and password & download it as csv file
- Paste URL into browser and we use sign-in page and our accountID populates as well & paste the username & password & click on remember this account
- Then it asks to change your password - give the old passowrd from csv and give it your own password matching the amazon policy for it to accept and click on confirm password change
